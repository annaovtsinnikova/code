<center><h1>The lord of the rings</h1></center>
<p><center>I genuinely admire this film series. It consists of 3 movies and is based on J. R. R. Tolkien books. <br>
    The story is set in fictional world of Middle Earth and tells about the hobbit Frodo Baggins as he <br>
    and the other characters try to destroy the One Ring and save the world from the evil Lord Sauron. </center> </p>
